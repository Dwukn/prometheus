# Site Blocker Chrome Extension

A powerful and user-friendly Chrome extension designed to help users block or archive websites to improve productivity and manage internet usage. The extension allows users to add sites to a blocked list, archive sites for a set duration, and manage their blocked and archived sites efficiently.

This extension includes features for importing/exporting site lists, periodic cleanup of archived sites, and bulk management of sites, making it easy to keep track of blocked domains and limit distractions.

## Features

- **Block Websites**: Add domains to a blocked list, automatically redirecting users to a "blocked" page.
- **Archive Websites**: Archive sites temporarily for a set period. Once the time expires, they automatically return to the blocked list.
- **Import/Export Sites**: Import blocked sites from `.txt` or `.json` files and export your blocked and archived site lists.
- **Manage Sites**: View, archive, delete, or export sites using an intuitive management interface.
- **Real-Time Blocking**: Sites on the blocked list will automatically be redirected to a custom `blocked.html` page.
- **Periodic Cleanup**: Archived sites that exceed their expiration time are automatically moved back to the blocked list.
