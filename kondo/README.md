> **Inspired by Marie Kondo**, the queen of decluttering, **Kondo** is a simple yet powerful CLI tool to tidy up your directories by organizing files into folders based on their extensions.

## ‚ú® Features

* Organizes files by their extension (e.g., `.jpg`, `.pdf`, `.txt`).
* Supports a `--dry-run` mode to preview changes without modifying any files.
* Simple and fast ‚Äî perfect for quick directory cleanups.
* Easy to use with minimal setup.

## üöÄ Usage

```bash
kondo [OPTIONS]
```

### Options

| Option            | Description                                                |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-d, --directory` | Specify the directory to organize (default is current `.`) |
| `--dry-run`       | Show what would happen without actually moving files       |

### Examples

Organize the current directory:

```bash
kondo
```

Organize a specific directory:

```bash
kondo --directory /path/to/your/folder
```

Preview what will happen (no files are moved):

```bash
kondo --directory /path/to/your/folder --dry-run
```

## üõ† How It Works

* **Scan**: The program scans all files in the specified directory (non-recursively).
* **Group**: Files are grouped based on their extensions.
* **Move**: Files are moved into new folders named after their extensions.

  * Files without an extension are moved into a folder called `no_extension`.

Example:

```
Before:
  - photo.jpg
  - document.pdf
  - notes.txt
  - README

After running `kondo`:
  /jpg/photo.jpg
  /pdf/document.pdf
  /txt/notes.txt
  /no_extension/README
```
