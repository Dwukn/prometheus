# Addition and Multiplication of Asymptotic Notations

### 1. **Big O (O)**: Upper Bound
- **Addition**: `O(f(n)) + O(g(n)) = O(max(f(n), g(n)))`
- **Multiplication**: `O(f(n)) · O(g(n)) = O(f(n) · g(n))`

### 2. **Big Omega (Ω)**: Lower Bound
- **Addition**: `Ω(f(n)) + Ω(g(n)) = Ω(min(f(n), g(n)))`
- **Multiplication**: `Ω(f(n)) · Ω(g(n)) = Ω(f(n) · g(n))`

### 3. **Big Theta (Θ)**: Tight Bound
- **Addition**: `Θ(f(n)) + Θ(g(n)) = Θ(max(f(n), g(n)))`
- **Multiplication**: `Θ(f(n)) · Θ(g(n)) = Θ(f(n) · g(n))`

### 1. **Big O (O) Notation**

Big O notation provides an **upper bound** for the growth rate of a function. It is used to describe the worst-case scenario of an algorithm.

- **Addition**: If you add two functions with (O)-notation, the larger of the two terms will dominate.
  - Example: `O(n^2) + O(n) = O(n^2)`
  - This is because `n^2` grows faster than `n` as `n` increases.

- **Multiplication**: When multiplying, you simply multiply the two growth rates.
  - Example: `O(n^2) · O(n) = O(n^3)`
  - This is because the product of `n^2` and `n` gives `n^3`.

### 2. **Big Omega (Ω) Notation**

Big Omega notation provides a **lower bound** for the growth rate of a function. It describes the best-case scenario or minimum growth rate for an algorithm.

- **Addition**: When adding two functions with (Ω)-notation, the smaller term will dominate (since you're looking at the minimum growth rate).
  - Example: `Ω(n^2) + Ω(n) = Ω(n)`
  - This is because `n` is the lower growth rate compared to `n^2`.

- **Multiplication**: When multiplying, you multiply the two functions' lower bounds.
  - Example: `Ω(n^2) · Ω(n) = Ω(n^3)`
  - This is because the lower bounds are combined by multiplying them.

### 3. **Big Theta (Θ) Notation**

Big Theta notation provides a **tight bound** for the growth rate of a function. It describes both the upper and lower bounds, effectively capturing the exact growth rate of a function.

- **Addition**: When adding two functions with (Θ)-notation, the larger growth rate dominates, just like with Big O.
  - Example: `Θ(n^2) + Θ(n) = Θ(n^2)`
  - This is because `n^2` is the dominant term in the sum.

- **Multiplication**: When multiplying, you multiply the two functions' growth rates.
  - Example: `Θ(n^2) · Θ(n) = Θ(n^3)`
  - This is because multiplying the two functions gives the result `n^3`.

### Key Points:
- **For Addition**:
  - **Big O**: Take the maximum of the two growth rates.
  - **Big Omega**: Take the minimum of the two growth rates.
  - **Big Theta**: Take the maximum of the two growth rates.

- **For Multiplication**:
  - **Big O**: Multiply the growth rates.
  - **Big Omega**: Multiply the growth rates.
  - **Big Theta**: Multiply the growth rates.

This way, you can handle any combinations of asymptotic notations and simplify them based on the rules for addition and multiplication.
