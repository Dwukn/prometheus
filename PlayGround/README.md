# Code-PlayGround

Welcome to **Code-PlayGround**! This repository serves as a hub for experimenting, learning, and exploring different programming languages and concepts. It includes various submodules where I experiment with languages like **Go** and **Rust**, as well as build fun projects like random websites.

Additionally, it contains a submodule for **CPPlex**, a space where I dive deep into C++ and explore low-level programming concepts.

## Submodules

This repository includes the following submodules:

- **GoLayers**: A project focused on learning and experimenting with backend development using the **Go** programming language.
- **RustleMania**: A Rust-based repository where I explore and learn how the **Rust** language works.
- **WebJunkyard**: A collection of random websites I’ve built for fun and learning.
- **CPPlex**: A space for learning and experimenting with **C++**. Explore the low-level power and flexibility of C++ through various hands-on projects and code samples.

## How to Set Up the Repository

To clone the repository along with all the submodules, run the following command:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Dwukn/Code-PlayGround.git
```

If you've already cloned the repository and need to initialize the submodules, use:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

This will ensure that you have all the submodules set up and their contents are properly retrieved.

## Usage

Each submodule has its own unique focus and contains its own README for more detailed usage instructions:

- **GoLayers**: Learn and experiment with backend development in Go. Contains code for exploring Go's capabilities.
- **RustleMania**: Experiment with and explore the Rust language. This submodule is focused on hands-on learning with Rust.
- **WebJunkyard**: A collection of random websites I’ve built for fun, creativity, and exploration of web development.
- **CPPlex**: Dive into the world of low-level C++ programming and explore powerful, system-level concepts.

## Contributing

Feel free to explore, learn, and contribute to any of the submodules! Each submodule has its own contributing guidelines, which you can find in their respective READMEs.
