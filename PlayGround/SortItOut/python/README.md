$${\color{orange} **NOTE:** \space Doing \space it \space in \space 2 \space days \space because \space I \space got \space too \space prepare \space for \space gate \space and \space only \space have \space  \space a \space month \space left.}$$
  


**Python programming** and the **basic data structures and algorithms** you've mentioned in **2 days**, you need an intensive and focused plan. Given the topics, we’ll break them down into manageable tasks for each day. Remember, this plan assumes you have basic programming knowledge, and it focuses on practice rather than theory alone.

### **Day 1: Python Basics & Introduction to Data Structures**

#### **Morning (3 hours): Python Basics**
- **Review Python syntax**: Data types, loops, conditionals, functions, and error handling.
  - Variables, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets.
  - Functions, loops, conditionals, and list comprehensions.
- **Practice Problems**: Write simple Python programs (e.g., basic calculators, number patterns, etc.)

#### **Midday (2 hours): Basic Data Structures**
- **Stacks**:
  - Learn the stack operations (`push`, `pop`, `peek`, `is_empty`).
  - Implement stack using Python lists.
  - Practice with problems like reversing a string, checking for balanced parentheses, etc.

- **Queues**:
  - Learn queue operations (`enqueue`, `dequeue`, `peek`, `is_empty`).
  - Implement a queue using a Python list and `collections.deque`.
  - Practice problems like simulating a printer queue or job scheduling.

#### **Afternoon (3 hours): More Data Structures**
- **Linked Lists**:
  - Understand singly linked lists and their operations (`insert`, `delete`, `search`, `traversal`).
  - Implement a singly linked list.
  - Practice problems like reversing a linked list, detecting loops, etc.

- **Trees**:
  - Learn binary trees and operations like `in-order`, `pre-order`, `post-order` traversal.
  - Implement a binary tree in Python.
  - Solve problems like finding the height of a tree, checking if a tree is balanced.

- **Hash Tables**:
  - Learn how hash tables work and their key operations (`insert`, `delete`, `search`).
  - Understand collision resolution techniques (e.g., separate chaining).
  - Implement a simple hash table.
  - Practice problems on counting occurrences of elements in a list, etc.

#### **Evening (2 hours): Search Algorithms**
- **Linear Search**:
  - Understand and implement linear search.
  - Practice problems like finding the first occurrence of an element.

- **Binary Search**:
  - Learn how binary search works on sorted arrays.
  - Implement binary search.
  - Solve problems like finding an element in a sorted array, or finding the insertion point for an element.

### **Day 2: Sorting Algorithms, Divide and Conquer, Graphs**

#### **Morning (3 hours): Sorting Algorithms**
- **Selection Sort**:
  - Learn how selection sort works and implement it.
  - Understand the time complexity and the algorithm’s efficiency.

- **Bubble Sort**:
  - Understand bubble sort and implement it.
  - Compare it with selection sort in terms of time complexity and performance.

- **Insertion Sort**:
  - Learn how insertion sort works and implement it.
  - Practice problems related to sorting small arrays and insertion of elements in a sorted list.

#### **Midday (2 hours): Divide and Conquer**
- **Merge Sort**:
  - Learn and implement merge sort (recursive approach).
  - Understand the divide-and-conquer paradigm.
  - Solve problems involving sorting large datasets.

- **Quick Sort**:
  - Learn and implement quick sort (recursive approach).
  - Compare it with merge sort in terms of performance.
  - Practice solving problems where quick sort is more efficient than bubble, selection, or insertion sort.

#### **Afternoon (2 hours): Introduction to Graph Theory**
- **Graph Basics**:
  - Understand the basic graph concepts: vertices, edges, directed vs undirected, weighted vs unweighted.
  - Learn different representations of graphs (adjacency matrix, adjacency list).
  - Implement a simple graph using an adjacency list.

- **Basic Graph Algorithms**:
  - **Graph Traversals**: Learn Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS).
    - Implement DFS and BFS for traversing graphs.
    - Practice problems like finding connected components or checking graph connectivity.

  - **Shortest Path Algorithms**:
    - **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**: Learn the basic idea behind Dijkstra's algorithm and its application.
    - Implement Dijkstra for finding the shortest path in a graph.
    - Practice problems involving finding the shortest path in weighted graphs.

#### **Evening (2 hours): Review and Practice**
- **Practice**:
  - Solve various problems on the topics covered (you can use platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or Codewars).
  - Focus on problems that integrate multiple concepts (e.g., combining linked lists and stacks).
  - Try to implement an algorithm without referring to notes to consolidate learning.

### For GATE prep also focus on analysis of algorithm
### **Additional Tips:**
- **Stay Focused**: The schedule is intense, but the key to mastering these concepts is consistent practice and focus. Don’t rush through topics—understand the underlying logic.
- **Use Online Resources**: If you get stuck, use Python documentation or look for explanations on platforms like GeeksforGeeks, Stack Overflow, or YouTube tutorials.
- **Practice Coding**: While theory is important, solving problems helps solidify the concepts.

By the end of these two days, you should have a good understanding of basic data structures, search and sorting algorithms, divide and conquer techniques, and introductory graph algorithms in Python. Keep practicing and apply these concepts to larger problems to further improve!
