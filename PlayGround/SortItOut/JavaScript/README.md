## **Day 1: JavaScript Basics & Introduction to Data Structures**

### **Morning (3 hours): JavaScript Basics**
- **Review JavaScript syntax**: Data types, operators, loops, conditionals, functions, and error handling.
  - **Key Topics**: `let`, `const`, `var`, strings, arrays, objects, null, undefined.
  - Functions: Declaration, expressions, and arrow functions.
  - Loops: `for`, `while`, `forEach`, and `map`.
  - Conditionals: `if`, `else`, `switch`.
  - **Practice Problems**: Simple programs like calculating factorial, palindrome check, etc.

## Day-2 **Midday (2 hours): Basic Data Structures**
#### **Stacks**:
  - Learn stack operations (`push`, `pop`, `peek`, `isEmpty`).
  - Implement stack using an array in JavaScript.
  - Practice problems like checking for balanced parentheses or reversing a string.

#### **Queues**:
  - Learn queue operations (`enqueue`, `dequeue`, `peek`, `isEmpty`).
  - Implement a queue using JavaScript arrays or `Array` methods like `shift()` and `push()`.
  - Practice problems like simulating a queue system (e.g., a job scheduler).

## Day-3 **Afternoon (3 hours): More Data Structures**
#### **Linked Lists**:
  - Learn singly linked lists and their operations (`insert`, `delete`, `search`, `traversal`).
  - Implement a singly linked list in JavaScript.
  - Practice problems like reversing a linked list or detecting loops in the list.

#### **Trees**:
  - Learn about binary trees and traversal techniques (`pre-order`, `in-order`, `post-order`).
  - Implement a basic binary tree in JavaScript.
  - Practice problems like checking if a binary tree is balanced or finding the height of a tree.

#### **Hash Tables**:
  - Learn about hash tables and their operations (`insert`, `delete`, `search`).
  - Implement a simple hash table using an array or object in JavaScript.
  - Practice problems like counting occurrences of elements in a list.

## Day-4 **Evening (2 hours): Search Algorithms**
#### **Linear Search**:
  - Understand the concept of linear search.
  - Implement linear search on an array.
  - Practice problems like finding the first occurrence of an element in an array.

#### **Binary Search**:
  - Learn binary search and its application on sorted arrays.
  - Implement binary search in JavaScript.
  - Solve problems like finding an element in a sorted array or finding the insertion point of an element.

## **Day 5: Sorting Algorithms, Divide and Conquer, Graph Theory**

### **Morning (3 hours): Sorting Algorithms**
#### **Selection Sort**:
  - Learn how selection sort works and implement it.
  - Understand the time complexity and performance.
  - Compare it with other sorting algorithms.

#### **Bubble Sort**:
  - Learn bubble sort and its mechanics.
  - Implement bubble sort in JavaScript.
  - Understand its inefficiency and the time complexity.

#### **Insertion Sort**:
  - Learn how insertion sort works and implement it.
  - Compare it with selection and bubble sort.
  - Practice sorting small datasets and inserting new elements into a sorted list.

## ** Day-6 (2 hours): Divide and Conquer**
### **Merge Sort**:
  - Learn the merge sort algorithm and implement it.
  - Understand the recursive nature and how it splits and merges the arrays.
  - Practice solving problems where merge sort is more efficient than bubble sort.

### **Quick Sort**:
  - Learn how quick sort works (recursive approach).
  - Implement quick sort.
  - Compare its performance with merge sort and other basic sorting algorithms.

## Day-7 (2 hours): Introduction to Graph Theory**
### **Graph Basics**:
  - Understand basic graph theory concepts: vertices, edges, directed vs undirected graphs, weighted vs unweighted graphs.
  - Learn different ways to represent graphs (adjacency list, adjacency matrix).
  - Implement a simple graph using adjacency lists in JavaScript.

### **Basic Graph Algorithms**:
  - **Graph Traversals**: Learn Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS).
    - Implement DFS and BFS in JavaScript for graph traversal.
    - Practice problems like finding connected components or checking if a graph is connected.

  - **Shortest Path Algorithms**:
    - **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**: Learn Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm and its implementation.
    - Implement Dijkstra’s algorithm for finding the shortest path in a weighted graph.
    - Solve problems related to finding the shortest path between nodes.

## Day-8 (2 hours): Review and Practice**
- **Review & Practice**:
  - Solve problems that combine multiple concepts (e.g., using a queue to simulate a printer job).
  - Use platforms like **LeetCode**, **HackerRank**, or **Codewars** to practice coding problems.
  - Try to implement an algorithm from scratch without looking at references to reinforce your understanding.

## **Additional Tips:**
- **Stay Focused**: The 2-day plan is packed, so it's essential to focus on learning and practicing. Don’t rush through topics—try to grasp the underlying concepts.
- **Use Online Resources**: Utilize JavaScript documentation, online courses, tutorials, or forums like Stack Overflow when you get stuck.
- **Practice Coding**: The key to mastering DSA is **consistent practice**. Work on coding problems every day to improve problem-solving skills.

By the end, you should have a solid understanding of basic data structures and algorithms in JavaScript, and be well-equipped to solve problems in competitive programming or real-world applications. Keep practicing and applying what you learn!
