Instructions for Running the Project

1. Run the Neural Network Training Script:
   - First, execute the `neural_network.py` file to train your neural network.
   ```bash
   python neural_network.py
   ```

2. Open the Main Notebook:
   - Open the `main.ipynb` notebook.

3. Set Training Parameters:
   - Set the number of epochs and batch size according to your requirements.

4. Train the Model:
   - Run the training cells in the notebook to train the model using the specified parameters.

5. Save the Model:
   - After training, save the trained model to a location of your choice.

6. Update Model Path:
   - Update the model path variable in the notebook to the location where you saved your trained model. Make sure the path is correct.
   
7. Set Image Path and Predict:
   - Set the path to an image that you want to make predictions on.

8. Run the Prediction:
   - Run the prediction cell in the notebook to see the model's prediction on the specified image.
