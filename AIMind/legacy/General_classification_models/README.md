# General Classification Models

This repository contains scripts to train and predict with general classification models using TensorFlow/Keras. The models are trained on a dataset and can predict classes based on input images.

## Project Structure

- **neural_network.py**: Python script to define and train neural network models.
- **main.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook to configure and train models, and perform predictions.


## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/the-w00d/General_classification_models.git
   cd General_classification_models
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   - Ensure you have Python 3.x and pip installed.
   - Install required libraries:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Run the training script**
   - Execute `neural_network.py` to train your neural network models:
     ```bash
     python neural_network.py
     ```
   - Adjust parameters like epochs and batch size in the script.

4. **Open the Jupyter notebook**
   - Launch Jupyter notebook:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook
     ```
   - Open and execute `main.ipynb`.
   - Set the correct paths for the model and images.

5. **Train the model in the notebook**
   - Configure the notebook to train the models with desired parameters.
   - Save the trained models to the specified location.

6. **Perform predictions**
   - Set the image path in the notebook to predict the classes for the images.
   - Run the prediction cells to see the model's output.

## File Descriptions

- **neural_network.py**: Script to define, train, and save neural network models.
- **main.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook to set parameters, train models, and perform predictions.
- **model/baseline_model.h5**: Trained baseline model saved in HDF5 format.
- **model/residual_model.h5**: Trained residual model saved in HDF5 format.
- **data/train/**: Folder containing training images.
- **data/validation/**: Folder containing validation images.
- **images/**: Folder containing images for predictions.
