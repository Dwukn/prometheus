# Hangman Game

This Hangman game is implemented in Python using the `tkinter` library for the graphical user interface.

## Description

This program allows users to play a classic Hangman game. The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list, and the player has to guess the word by entering letters. The game provides feedback on correct and incorrect guesses, displays the progress of the word, and tracks the number of remaining tries. After the game ends (either by running out of tries or guessing the word correctly), players can start a new game by clicking the "Try Again" button.
